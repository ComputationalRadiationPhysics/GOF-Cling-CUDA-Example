# Content

The notebook `GameOfLife.ipynb` contains a detailed and self-explanatory example of the CUDA extension of Cling. This is the first notebook you should open. The folder `GTC_presentations` contains the example notebooks of the GTC 2020 session `CUDA C++ in Jupyter: Adding CUDA Runtime Support to Cling` [1].

# Save your notebooks

The container copies the notebooks into the folder `/tmp/GOL-xeus-cling-cuda/notebook` before starting the Jupyter Notebook server. So you can save and share your modified notebooks.
